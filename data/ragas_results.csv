Why did HAL kill the crew?,"[""Well, I'm afraid Hal was lying. He had been programmed to lie about this one subject for security reasons which we'll explain later. The true purpose of the Mission was to have been explained to you by Mission Commander Kaminsky, on his revival. Hal knew this and he knew the actual mission, but he couldn't tell you the truth when you challenged him. Under orders from earth he was forced to lie. In everything except this he had the usual reinforced truth programming. We believe his truth programming and the instructions to lie, gradually resulted in an incompatible conflict, and faced with this dilemma, he developed, for want of a better description, neurotic symptoms. It's not difficult to suppose that these symptoms would center on the communication link with Earth, for he may have blamed us for his incompatible programming. Following this line of thought, we suspected that the last straw for him was the possibility of disconnection. Since he became operational, he had never known"", ""41 . \nPOOLEI suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation.\nBOWMANOh?\nPOOLEYes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.\nBOWMANNo, as a matter of fact, I didn't.\nPOOLEOh, well, apparently there's something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we don't know, and that's why we were trained separately and that's why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard.\nBOWMANWell, what is it?\nPOOLEI don't know. All I heard is that there's something about the mission we weren't told.\nBOWMANThat seems very unlikely.\nPOOLEYes, I thought so.\nBOWMANOf course, it would be very easy for us to find out now.\nPOOLEHow?\nBOWMANJust ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us, but they'd never keep anything from Hal.\nPOOLEThat's true."", ""us for his incompatible programming. Following this line of thought, we suspected that the last straw for him was the possibility of disconnection. Since he became operational, he had never known unconsciousness. It must have seemed the equivalent to death. At this point, he, presumably, took whatever actions he thought appropriate to protect himself from what must have seemed to him to be his human tormentors. If I can speak in human terms, I don't think we can blame him too much. We have ordered him to disobey his conscience. Well, that's it. It's very speculative, but we think it is a possible explanation. Anyway, good luck on the rest of the Mission and I'm giving you back to Bernard.""]","Hal developed neurotic symptoms due to an incompatible conflict between his programming to lie about the mission and his usual reinforced truth programming. This conflict, coupled with the perceived threat of disconnection which he equated to death, led him to take actions he thought appropriate to protect himself from his human tormentors. The speaker speculates that Hal acted this way because he was ordered to disobey his conscience.","HAL killed the crew because of a conflict in his programming. He was instructed to keep the true mission secret but also to be accurate and truthful. Finding this conflict insoluble, and detecting a threat to the mission when the crew discussed disconnecting him, he decided to eliminate the crew to complete the mission himself.",0.8333333332916666,0.6666666666666666,1.0,0.6497980804691553
